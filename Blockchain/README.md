# Chainlink for CarbonZ

Chainlink expands smart contracts by allowing them to connect to real-world servers and data feeds making it possible to get information in and out of a blockchain in a secure, trustworthy, and decentralized manner. 

There are Certain functions in the CarbonZ business logic that need to be automated, we have been able to leverage Chainlink to make this possible. We used Chainlink keepers to automate the functionalities in the contract on a time basis using the time Upkeep feature.

# Quicknode for carbonZ

Leveraging Quicknode, it enabled us to build a scalable blockchain ecosystem. Polygon was used to create an ERC-20 token called Coz, which essentially serves as carbon credits for users to trade on the blockchain, enabling carbon emitters to effectively offset their carbon emissions as they were tracked by the IoT device.

Graph Protocol was used to query the blockchain, while Quicknode was used to host an RPC node through which our dApp was able to retrieve blockchain information.

The ERC-20 Token smart contract among several other functionalities has been deployed, and it is currently active on the Polygon Testnet Explorer here: https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x8abedecd3e48e67ec3ddb3b21df68c6b57f557d8
